Interpretation of Clusters in Graph
===================================

1. General Description:
-----------------------
The scatter plot shows a segmentation of clients based on two normalized variables:
- Purchase frequency (x-axis)
- Visit frequency (y-axis)

The data is divided into four main clusters, identified by distinct colors (red, green, violet, brown). Additionally, two other types of points are represented:
- Outliers (blue), representing atypical clients.
- Border points (orange), which are not clearly attributed to a specific cluster.

2. Interpretation of Main Clusters:
-----------------------------------
Cluster 1 (Red):
- Location: Top-left
- Clients: Low to moderate purchase frequency but high visit frequency.
- Interpretation: Likely clients who visit often but purchase little. They may respond well to strategies encouraging purchases.

Cluster 2 (Green):
- Location: Top-right
- Clients: High purchase frequency and high visit frequency.
- Interpretation: Loyal and profitable clients. A key segment to retain through VIP programs or rewards.

Cluster 3 (Brown):
- Location: Bottom-left
- Clients: Low purchase frequency and low visit frequency.
- Interpretation: Likely occasional or unengaged clients. Marketing strategies could aim to increase their engagement.

Cluster 4 (Violet):
- Location: Bottom-right
- Clients: Moderate to high purchase frequency but low visit frequency.
- Interpretation: Likely planners who make large purchases during infrequent visits. Targeted promotions could encourage more frequent visits.

3. Outliers (Blue):
-------------------
- Represent atypical behaviors, such as clients with very high or very low frequencies.
- Possible action: Analyze these cases individually to identify specific opportunities or issues (e.g., ultra-loyal clients or dissatisfied ones).

4. Border Points (Orange):
--------------------------
- Not firmly attached to a cluster and can be considered intermediate cases.
- Possible action: Review segmentation parameters to better include these points.

5. Strategic Recommendations:
-----------------------------
- Green cluster (loyal): Retain through rewards programs.
- Red and brown clusters (occasional): Encourage purchases and engagement through marketing initiatives.
- Violet cluster (planners): Use promotions to increase visit frequency.
- Outliers and border points: Conduct further analysis to adjust offers or understand specific needs.
